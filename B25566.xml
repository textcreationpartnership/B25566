            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO His dread and Soveraigne Lord, JAMES the first, of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> King, <hi>&amp;c. Grace and Peace.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HOw many there are (most Noble King) that have aimed at the unfolding of this divine and hidden Prophecy, would require the skill and vertue of a Prophet to refer. 'T sufficeth to know they have all left the mark very faire and open for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to hit; Wherein, howsoever their Zeale, by privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of charity, may find excuse, yet their ignorance and errour, within these cases (no lesse hurtfull to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then dangerous to the Writer) may not find the like grace.</p>
            <p>What I have seen or dreamt, I feare not to offer to the censure of time, the discoverer of error, and Mother of truth, appointed from above, th'only indubitate touch-stone of all divine and Propheticall enterprises.</p>
            <p>And although your Highnesse may doubt of my bold and hardy direction in this dangerous and scopulous sea, wherein so many great and learned Pilots have overshot the Cape, as one that feareth all Physitians for that he hath fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of so many unskillfull; yet forasmuch as the Church is sicke, and the physick of this prophesie needfull, I could not chuse but speak the things I know, leaving to your Princely gust to iudge whether the Needle of my Compasse bee truer toucht then theirs.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:105478:3"/>
            <p>And for this prophesie was directed chiefly unto Kings, unto a King I have the rather presumed to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the same: and unto You (most noble King) before all other, whose fame of wisedome, Justice, and goodnesse, hath advanc'd your name and Scepter higher then any power of greatnesse can doe.</p>
            <p>And although it bee presented by one awaked out of time, yet if it may find but a litle protection under your gracious favour for a season, yeares and age, I doubt not, will give it admiration and honour enough.</p>
            <p>In hope of which grace most humbly I reverence your most Princely hands, commending all their labours to the God of Heaven, who hath exalted your arme so high and made you so honourable throughout his world.</p>

                  <p>And albeit his perfection in evill stood yet aloof, and was very far off, young and tender, as lying in swathing clouts; yet the Apostle descryeth him, as it were through a chink, in saying, <hi>comming up.</hi> For after the translation of the Empire, and that now <hi>Ethnick Rome</hi> began to play the Christian, he was well nigh a hundred years closely creeping &amp; climbing up,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105478:21"/> before he could advance his cursed head and claim of super-eminency. Concerning which ambitious puffe of vaine priority, so fair and evident mention is made in the monuments of time, that the incredible bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the adversary is no lesse marvellous then his incurable blindnesse, that hath so long time stumbled at this stone, and so often spurred us by way of vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to shew them (if we dare or can) when this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie of Antichrist tooke her rise and first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement: which daring vaunt of theirs, the holy Ghost tripping over as a thing which is or ought to be knowne unto us, namely, that the horne of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ and his apostasie did then first sprout out, when his Church first obtained at the Dragons hand, prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of place, suffrage and censure over all. For as the Tree puls up the creeping Ivie, so the primacie of the Church of Rome pulled up th'aspiring supremacie of the Bishop thereof; which Church preheminence and prelation (after long ruffling and shouldring) was first obtained at the hands of <hi>Honorius</hi> (tho af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards upon greater concertation and daggers drawing, it was by other Cesars and Kings confirmed, renewed and ampliated) who by th'advantage of the weaknesse and death of his elder brother <hi>Arcadius,</hi> having obtained power and protector-ship East and West, subjected the Church of the East Empire (which most withstood the West and Romane supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie) with all other Churches whatsoever, to the Church and Sea of Rome, at the instant suit and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the now Bishop of Rome, whose name was then <hi>Innocent</hi> the first, in the first year of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the yeare of Redemption 406.</p>
                  <p>But the holy Ghost (I say) passing over the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall and exact moment of time, when the Egge of Antichrist and his apostacie was first laid, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where sufficiently preserved unto us, proceedeth to detect the place where and from whence he should

                  <p>Secondly, in pride of life, in pomp and luxury, the Spirit equalleth him with the Monarch of <hi>Persia,</hi> and likeneth his arrogant and voluptuous gate to her ten Kings, here (as in <hi>Daniel</hi>) deciphered by a Beare, <hi>And his feet as of a Beare.</hi>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105478:23"/> which seven, the Assyrian Monarchie was the first, and the Roman the sixth, of both which and their pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellows, is further revealed in the 17. Chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Meane time we are here to observe, that as the holy Ghost doth therefore call his seven heads by the name of seven hils, because the seat of Antichrist should be there, and not elsewhere placed and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; so he nameth them also <hi>seven Kings,</hi> because the power of Antichrist should be an extraordinary sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, compounded of such spirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall claims and jurisdictions, as should be equivalent in presumption and prophanation, to all the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of the seven Monarchies, which from the beginning hitherunto, have blasphemed God, and corrupted his world.</p>
                  <p>This foundation laid, doth shew, that this deadly wound given to one of his heads, which (as after ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth) was the wound of a sword, cannot be meant of any one of his heads after the first signification, as they are hills, but as they are Kings, and subject to the sword: and so by consequence intendeth, that one of his imperiall heads, and namely his faire <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> his minion, Lord and Master of Rome, of whom he had so lately received his breath and being, was so deadly wounded, as that the Beast himselfe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was in great danger of extinction. Thus having found the head, let us look unto the wound, that so we may the better discerne the great danger the Beast was in, delivered in these words, <hi>as it were slaine to death.</hi> This deadly wound was given and driven home to the head by the sword and incursion of the West Gothes, under the leading of <hi>Alaricus,</hi> who in the nineteenth year of <hi>Caesar Honorius</hi> (of whom the Beast some foure yeares before had received his life) entred Italy, and gave such a deadly stroke unto his powerfull pate, that for very feare, the beast lockt himselfe up in his den at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> while the enemy
